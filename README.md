# IBM_Cloud_ML_Project
 Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machinery is the Machine Learning project. The goal is to create a classification model that  can predict the type of failure (e.g., tool wear, heat dissipation, power failure) based on  real-time operational data. With the help of IBM Cloud Lite services Project has been executed.
